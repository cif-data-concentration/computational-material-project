# computational-material-project
The project contains two separate parts. One is to extract the information of molecules from the cif files and compile to pandas dataframe, the other is to use machine learning to analyze the relationship between crystal structure and the band gap. And create an user interface to output the predicted bandgap value.

## CIF Processing
The first component of the computational material project is the preprocessing of `.cif` files, which is an international standardized data format that stores the structural information of molecules. We are motivated to provide a tool that does massive reading and data extraction to provide the first step towards any statistical or computational analysis. 

Combining with the advanced **Materials Project** and its API access, we also designed a download function that helps people without computer science context to select materials of interested band gap boundaries, without learning the complex syntax required in the original `pymatgen` package.

In the CIF Processing folder, there is `CIF_process.py` that could be directly executed from the command line by calling `python CIF_process.py`. Following the sequential prompt to provide your information, you will be able to obtain a csv file made from either the downloaded data or the local files.


A practice as well as an exploratory study of this data processing program is also provided, which makes of the second part of the project. We applied several machine learning models on the data frame containing all materials with a band gap fall in the visible light spectrum from `Materials Project`, generated by `CIF_process.py`. The generated data file is provided in doc/dataset in this repo.

## Machine Learning

### Decision Tree & Random Forest
__Current Functionality__:
- [x] Model optimization using hyperparameters tuning
- [x] Train a decision tree and random forest model
- [x] Predict bandgap with the decision tree regressor and random forest regressor model
- [x] Create an user interface to output the predicted bandgap

### User Interface to predict the band gap
In the right hand side, users can enter the crystal lattice constant and choose the machine learning method and then the left hand side will output the predict band gap value.

## Next step and lessons learned
- Add more flexible and customizable components in the CIF processing program, so that users could select properties other than band gaps for downloading.
- Current CIFconvert() only extracts the cell length and cell angles from the cif files. We hope to include user-input-initiated selection of parameters to extract from the cif files.
- Based on the improvement of the above functionality, we are also interested to design an UI for this component as well.
- The exploration with machin learning and molecule structure-property relationship indicates that the current hypothesis regarding a correlation between crystalline cell parameters and the band gap needs to be further refined, as the example dataset `bg_struct.csv` didn't control non-structural factors that could impact the band gap.
