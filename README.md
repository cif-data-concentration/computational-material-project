# computational-material-project
 _The project contains two separate parts. One is to extract the information of molecules from the cif file and compile to pandas dataframe, the other is to use machine learning to analyze the relationship between crystal structure and the band gap.
\
## Cif Adaptor
_This adaptor is a pre-process algorithm that massively extracts structural information from either user uploaded raw files in the same path or the open-source library using API for data access and then append the information with the properties of substances from the known libraries(Material Project).

## Machine Learning
_Explore a specific structure-property relationship between lattice constants and the bandgap of a chosen range of materials.
